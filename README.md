# Cash register system

Setting: We are the IT department of a chain grocery store company and we are going to design an advanced cash register system for our stores.

*Problem Statement:*

Vision: Our system aims to optimize the efficiency in the process of settling bills of grocery stores in terms of reducing the waiting time as well as increasing the profitability.

Issue Statement: According to the customers' opinion, the original cashier system cannot afford the increasing customer flow. They usually need to use more than 15 minutes to make a settlement and sometimes they will leave without buying anything becasue of the long waiting time. Therefore, we need to update our cash register system to avoid the excessive waiting time and also the damage to our profit.

Method: We will use a C++ program as the main body of our system. The new register system is able to read the type, price and amount of our product, calculate the processing time of each customer and the profit and also sort the customer.
